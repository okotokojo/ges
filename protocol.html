	<ul>
	
		<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li>
		

				
						<li style="margin-top: 4px;">Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li>
						<li style="margin-top: 4px;">Don’t share food, beverages or smoking devices with others</li>
						<li style="padding-top: 4px;">Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
		<li style="padding-top: 4px;">Avoid shaking hands—try a fist bump instead</li>
						<li style="margin-top: 4px;">Stay home when sick</li>
						<li style="margin-top: 4px;">Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces</li>
						<li style="margin-top: 4px;">Cough or sneeze into your elbow or sleeve or cover coughs or sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue directly into the trash</li>
